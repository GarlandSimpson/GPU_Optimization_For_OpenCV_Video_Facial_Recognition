# GPU_Optimization_For_OpenCV_Video_Facial_Recognition

This is a modification in the works for OpenCV Video Facial Recognition. The goal was to study general facial recognition methods as well as optimize the given code for a GPU. NOTE: There is CUDA optimization already available as well.

<ul> Be advised: Database sanitation is critical
  <li> All videos must have the same frame rate and resolution</li>
  <li> All images must have the same deminsions </li>
  <li> Grayscaling images reduces data size by 2/3rd and also reduces interference from lighting</li>
</ul>
